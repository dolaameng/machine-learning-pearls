    "I was asked whether Randall was wrong to come up with \"only\" a 10-character Star Wars regex, whereas I showed there is a 9-character version. I would say that, given his role as a cartoonist, author, public speaker, educator, and entertainer, he has chosen ... wisely. He wrote a program that was good enough to allow him to make a great webcomic. A 9-character regex would not improve the comic. Randall stated that he used a genetic algorithm to find his regexes, and it has been said that genetic algorithms are often the second (or was it the third?) best method to solve any problem, and that's all he needed. But if you consider that in addition to all those roles, Randall is also still a practicing computer scientist, you could say he chose ... poorly. Genetic algorithms are good when you want to combine the structure of two solutions to yield a better solution, so they would work well if the best regexes had a complicated tree structure. But they don't! The best solutions are disjunctions of small parts. So the genetic algorithm is trying to combine the first half of one disjunction with the second half of anotherâ€”but that isn't useful, because the components of a disjunction are unordered; imposing an ordering on them doesn't help.\n",
